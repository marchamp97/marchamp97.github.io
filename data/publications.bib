  ABSTRACT = {{We present a formal proof (at the implementation level) of an efficient
algorithm proposed by Paul Zimmermann to compute square 
roots of arbitrarily large integers.
This program, which is part of the GNU Multiple Precision 
Arithmetic Library (GMP), is completely proven within the 
Coq system. Proofs are developed using the {\sc Correctness} tool 
to deal with imperative features of the program.
The formalization is rather large (more than 13000 lines) and requires
some advanced techniques for proof management and reuse.
